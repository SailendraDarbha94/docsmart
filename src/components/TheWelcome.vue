    <template #heading>Front End Nanodegree </template>
    Got frustrated outta my mind with college and the accompanying shenanigans so took a few years
    break & completed a full front-end course co-created by Google and offered by Udacity for a
    duration of 6 months.

    <template #heading>User Interface Design Specialization</template>
    My interest in the field of design grew immensely and so I took up a five course specialization
    including a capstone project that was taught by esteemed professors at University of Minnesota.

    Twas about time I went back to my old college and finish what I'd left halfway through, cause
    I'm not a quitter (<span class="dark:text-green-300 text-purple-700"

    <template #heading>First Job</template>
    Thought I was doomed to freelance as companies didn't seem interested in hiring dentists to
    build websites, but then, got my first break at

      class="dark:text-green-300 hover:bg-transparent text-blue-700"

    <template #heading>Second Job</template>
    The next year was wonderful and terrifying at the same time, cause the lockdowns were gone and
    there was an actual office to go to with a real coffee machine, but my imposter syndrome peaked
    cause when you're surrounded by super talented people in a unicorn startup such as
    <a

      class="dark:text-yellow-300 text-blue-700 hover:bg-transparent"

    it is a kind of overwhelming that I can't describe here
